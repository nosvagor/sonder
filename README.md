#### ...and in this context?

_sonder_ is the working title of a screenplay with a unique conceptual idea
that aims explore this feeling.

<br>

## so, what's the idea?

The core idea is to delve into the concept of narrative reference frames and,
in doing so, demonstrate how a single story can have numerous, distinct, and
valid interpretations. The story will encompass variable character arcs and
genres that could change drastically, depending solely on the point at which
one starts listening to the tale.

The objective is to embrace the feeling of _sonder_ by eliminating the notion
of a clear beginning and an end to a story. There will be no designated
protagonist or antagonist and no absolute meaning. Instead, meaning will emerge
within the relative narrative reference frame, primarily modulated by
strategically withholding key information that could dramatically alter the
perception of characters' choices.

The challenge will be to craft a story that randomly begins at **n** _(n > 3)_
different points, depending on the intricacy of the interwoven
complexity. Where one starts the story could make some characters seem
significant, malevolent, benevolent, or even inconsequential. The intention is
to allow the viewer to incorporate their own life story, biases, values, and
personal perspective into the narrative. Achieving this would result in
enabling the viewer to experience genuine emotions, instead of dictating how
they should feel.

Moreover, the story will need to conceal the fact that it is narrating across
time in a non-linear fashion; otherwise, the instinct to construct a linear
narrative will still be too strong. Exploiting audience expectations is vital
for this concept to work, as the ultimate goal is to reveal how these
expectations can shape the story itself.

Another potential avenue to exploit expectations would be to release the film
with hundreds of subtly edited variations without disclosing this
information. The revelation should emerge organically post-release. The
logistics of accomplishing this may be complex, but overcoming these challenges
is already necessary to deliver the full impact of this innovative concept due
to the random assignment of where the movie begins for each viewing.

Thus, even after watching the movie (or having it spoiled), then the audience
should still find it difficult to grasp the complete scope and the multitude of
interwoven stories, leading them to appreciate the momentary wonder of the
sheer combinatorial complexity of life that _sonder_ embodies.

In the end, true success would be achieved by invoking the feeling of being
incredibly small and insignificant in the grand scheme of things, while
simultaneously highlight the grandiose and special feeling that arises from
our uniquely privileged position we have in the universe, wherein we have to
ability to have an experience in and of itself.

### what's the story about?

The story would revolve around a diverse cast of characters, each designed to
evoke deep connections with viewers, allowing them to feel like they might be
the main character themselves or have their favorite character take center
stage.

No single character would possess plot armor or remain essential throughout the
entire movie. Each character would become entwined with or complement other
characters' stories to varying degrees. This technique would instill the sudden
realization inherent in sonder, in which one recognizes they may merely be an
extra in someone else's remarkable journey.

Moreover, each character would embody a significant philosophical question and
be utilized to explore virtues or principles that might seem obvious but can be
rather nuanced.

This approach stems from a principled assumption that most genres, if not all,
are primarily core philosophical discussions in disguise. People's preference
for specific genres often reveals a fascination with complex concepts typically
best expressed through stories. This is why movie are important, because they
often serve as a medium through which society indirectly deliberates and agrees
upon shared ethics and morality.

Embracing this assumption will help clarify the central idea: there is no
single story. The intention is to intertwine numerous stories, each
incorporating their own genre and narrative beats, while allowing them to stand
independently yet be subtly influenced by their relationship with other
stories.

Ultimately, the aim is to foster discussions on challenging topics and
encourage epistemic humility by demonstrating how one's position in relation to
the subject can significantly affect one's opinion. Ideally, the story as
a whole would emphasize the importance of valuing diverse perspectives,
appreciating the bigger picture before passing judgment, and recognizing how
subtle differences in perceived facts can drastically alter conclusions.


### well, where is the screenplay?

At this time, nothing has been written because I believe each character and
narrative arc must emerge from a series of complex discussions. It's unlikely
that this concept could be written by a single person or even a small group of
people. Instead, I envision it being created in a decentralized manner,
allowing multiple voices and stories to be expressed and combined into
something greater than their individual parts.

Ultimately, the specifics of the story don't concern me as much as the
innovative concept being realized. Imagine the excitement of discovering that
the movie you just saw had subtle variations and a completely different
sequence when discussing it with a friend. Moreover, this approach would
provide a truly unique and engaging repeat viewing experience.

For now, I'm merely working on a way to generate the in-depth discussions from
a large, diverse group. I believe that gathering input from various
perspectives will greatly enrich the final product and add layers of complexity
that would be difficult to achieve otherwise.

To that end, I encourage anyone who is intrigued by this concept to start
a conversation, offer suggestions, or share ideas to improve and refine this
ambitious project. The more people contribute, the better we can capture the
essence of sonder and create a truly groundbreaking film.

In an effort to facilitate collaboration, I have decided to create a repository
where individuals can share their thoughts, experiences, and creative
insights. This platform will not only make it easier for participants to engage
in discussions but also provide a space to foster creativity and harness the
collective wisdom of the community.

Join this collaborative journey! Let's embark on the challenge of creating
a film that truly reflects the complexity of the human experience and
celebrates the beauty of our interconnected lives.
