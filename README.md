#### ...and in this context?

_sonder_ is the working title of a screenplay with a unique conceptual idea.

<br>

## So what's the idea?

rough draft WIP
<!-- The idea is to explore the concept of narrative reference frames. Particularly, -->
<!-- the goal is to demonstrate how even a single story can have significantly -->
<!-- different interpretations. If done right, then the story would encompass -->
<!-- variable character arcs and genres, that could change drastically, simply based -->
<!-- on when one started the movie. -->
<!---->
<!-- Essentially, the idea is to completely embrace the feeling of _sonder_ by -->
<!-- removing the concept of a beginning and an end to a story. There is no -->
<!-- protagonist, no antagonist, no true meaning. Instead, meaning would emerge -->
<!-- within the relative narrative reference frame, primarily modulated by hiding -->
<!-- key bits information that would dramatically change perception of characters -->
<!-- choices. -->
<!---->
<!-- The trick would be to create a story that randomly starts in a **N** _(N > 3)_ -->
<!-- number of spots, depending on how well the complexity is woven -->
<!-- together. Where one started the story would make some characters seem -->
<!-- important, bad, good or even irrelevant. -->
<!---->
<!-- Furthermore, the story would have to hide the fact that it was narrating across -->
<!-- time, otherwise the drive to fulfill a linear narrative would still be to -->
<!-- strong. -->
<!---->
<!-- The story revolves around a large cast of characters and is structured in -->
<!-- a circular, non-linear fashion, with no fixed start or end. -->
